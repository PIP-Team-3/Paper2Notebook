        "caption": "In her sunny Word Workshop, Maya wants to build a Sentence Sorter that can tell what a sentence means or feels. She wonders: could a tiny, simple setup work as well as a giant, fancy machine?",
        "visual_prompt": "A cozy wooden workshop with warm light and string lights. Maya, an 8-year-old with curly hair, a yellow hoodie, denim overalls, and red sneakers, stands by a workbench. Beside her is Dot, a tiny silver robot with one blue eye and a happy smile. On the bench: a small blue one-step stool, a neat stack of paper sentence ribbons, and a friendly panel labeled 'decision dial'. Soft labels: 'question', 'reader tool'.",

Maya smiles, holding a small tray labeled 'pattern finder'. The decision dial rests nearby. Soft labels: 'ready-made', 'learns'.",

        "visual_prompt": "Maya and Dot at the bench. A sentence ribbon runs under three ink rollers labeled '3-word', '4-word', '5-word'. Each roller leaves soft stamped shapes; one stamp glows brightest with a tiny tag 'strong clue'. A small wire runs from the stamps to the 'decision dial' with a light that can turn on. Soft labels: 'strong clue', 'best stamp'.",

        "visual_prompt": "The bench now shows two card feeders side by side: one marked 'frozen', one marked 'tuned', both leading into the rollers. A small toggle reads 'two-deck'. Some stamps glow, others look normal, suggesting mixed success. Maya and Dot watch thoughtfully. Soft labels: 'two-deck', 'maybe helps'.",
